# hello-world
Nothing! Just my first repository

Hey guys, 
This is me, Vidushi, exploring Git! 
I am a Btech. third year student currently working on my programming skills(mainly C++ and python)
I have a tendency to go into "pre-test reels/youtube spirals" to get rid of 'em mild exam jitters.
Don't particularly need a reason to procrastinate, IT JUST HAPPENS!! (usually in the guise of reading)
